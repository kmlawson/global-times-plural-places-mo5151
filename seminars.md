# MO5151 Seminars

Our module meets every two weeks since the two 20 credit core modules stretch over an entire year. In between the seminars, however, are "surgery sessions" which are optional meetings of one to two hours in the office indicated of the tutor noted on the overview schedule at the regular hours of our class. Think of this as an extra office hour, a chance to get to know tutors and their research better, share ideas with fellow programme students and the tutor about your writing, or jump start a discussion about the readings for the session ahead. Some tutors may offer more structure. 

*Note:* the writing workshop session is swapped, taking place in week 10 and the surgery session in week 11 in order to allow you more time after the writing workshop to continue work on your empirical essay.

*Readings:* The key readings are available in our online library databases, ebooks, and in some cases in the "short loan" section of the library. Further readings are often in the library available for checking out. However, please be aware that fellow students in the programme may also which to read them and consider sharing the books among yourselves after checking them out or leaving them in the library if there is only a single copy.

*General Notes on Preparation:* Please come to seminar having read at least the "key readings" from week to week. Please be able to say what the main argument of each text was, what examples or case studies it uses to make its argument, and both what your critiques and constructive take away is from the main texts. Consider reading or skimming at least one of the further readings. Always reserve several hours each week to make progress on your assessments and be prepared to talk about your progress on these in class.

### Week 1 - Introduction: Transnational as Spatial History?  - Konrad

*Abstract:* This is our opening session. We will talk about the structure of the course, the expectations for the essays, and open with some of the big questions. What are transnational, global, and spatial histories? What brought you to this as a programme?  We will explore each of our interests and evaluate where they might potentially fit in this cluster of fields. Our key readings hint at some of the big questions and problems. 

*Preparation:* After tackling the readings, think about your own specific area of interest. What would constitute a global, transnational, or spatial approach to historical problems related to your own area of interest. Do a bit of searching and see if you can identify a work or two that you think might represent this approach and skim it. Be prepared to comment on it when you come to class and if there is extra time we'll discuss them.

### Week 5  - Working With Scales in History - Konrad

Abstract: Is global history necessarily large or big history? At what level, size and scale can or should global and transnational history be practiced? How and where are global connections and transnational “objects” (people, ideas, commodities) best studied? How can the different levels of analysis and empirical work across borders, countries and cultures be connected? These are some of the main questions we wish to address in this session.

### Week 10 - Writing Workshop - Dawn

This workshop will introduce you to some new ways of thinking about writing as a process: what you do to produce an essay or a dissertation. You will have the chance to think about and discuss your own experiences of writing, and to try out some techniques designed to make the writing process as smooth and pain-free as possible. 

Please come to the workshop prepared to write. This means you should, at the very least, have an outline/plan of your empirical essay to work with. Please also bring your preferred writing equipment (laptop, tablet, pen and paper) along with you to this session.

In advance of the session, please have a read of [‘The Perfect Sentence Vortex and How to Escape It’ by Katherine Firth](https://researchvoodoo.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/the-perfect-sentence-vortex-and-how-to-escape-it/) at the Research Voodoo. Beyond this short blog post, the remaining time you would usually spend reading for our seminar should be entirely dedicated to working on your empirical essay. Be sure you make the most of this! 

* Week 11 surgery session with Konrad
