**Abstract**

This session will focus on examples of French and British imperial expansion and maritime trade in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. You are, however, encouraged to read more widely to prepare for the session (engaging with the broader traditions of Atlantic/Mediterranean history, and new work on the Indian and Pacific Oceans). We will relate the examples listed below to the use and meaning(s) of labels such as ‘empire’ and ‘Atlantic world’, and will also discuss how we might conceive of the ocean: was the sea a ‘transnational’ or a ‘global’ space?
