### Description	

MO5151 is part of a two-part core component for the MLitt in Transnational and Spatial History and offers a strong foundation in the major approaches to comparative and transnational history as well as the emerging field of spatial history. This first semester introduces the origins of these new ways of looking at the past, as well as some of the major methodological challenges faced. The course then shifts to consider transnational agents, networks, and new approaches to doing history between the micro and macro scales.

### Assessment Summary

**100% Coursework**  

*Note:* Word limits include footnotes but not bibliography.

*19 Oct - 1,000 word historiographical essay* (25%)

This first short essay should choose a theme or question addressing some aspect of transnational, global, or spatial history. You may take one of three approaches: 1) choose a theme and give an overview of different scholarly approaches to it, making an argument around what you believe is to be a preferred approach, common strengths or weaknesses, or shows promise for new directions. 2) You may focus in on a single key work on a theme and evaluate it in the light of other related scholarship. This must not simply be a book review, this should connect the work actively to other scholarship around your own argument. 3) identify a key concrete example (a context, a location, a set of figures or community, etc.) which has not received much direct scholarly attention and then suggest the various ways that existing scholarship on related questions or comparable contexts might inform research on this particular case. You do not need to do any significant primary source research on the particular case beyond the minimum necessarily to establish the context. You may choose a theme or topic related to, ideally at a more general level, the research for the empirical research essay in order to get you started on it, but you may not, of course, use any of the text of the essay itself for the second essay.

Important: The essay *should make a clear identifiable argument* or answer a clear analytical question and evaluate its argument in the light of other what other historians have to say. Primary sources are not required for this exercise. The assessment is designed as a way to get you to explore a field of scholarship in some depth. You may, if you like, choose a topic that is broadly helpful to you for your research essay in the spring for the core module, or at least indirectly related to topics you may be considering for the masters dissertation.

This essay is most of all a challenge due to its short word limit. One of the skills that is developed in this work is how to write concisely and practice cutting and reshaping an essay. Resist the temptation to make many distinct points, but select a very small set of related points that support a main argument. You are strongly encouraged to go through multiple drafts. This is not a book review, but reading a collection of book reviews or "review essays" in historical journals such as *Past & Present*, *Journal of Global History* etc. or monthly literary journals such as the *London Review of Books*, *New York Review of Books* etc. will give you clues as to how to structure and make arguments with very limited space. When evaluating scholarship, 5-12 works of scholarship is probably a good range to aim for, depending on the depth of your engagement with the sources in the essay. A few questions to ask yourself as you write this:

* Do I have a clearly identifiable and falsifiable argument or answer an analytic question?
* Have I gone beyond mentioning other scholarship to draw out and evaluate specific arguments of other historical scholarship related to my point
* Have I focused in on a small number of key points rather than making many less well-developed points?
* Have I gone over the essay and cut all sentences which are not essential for the argument or the set up, and made use of the space allowed to strengthen and develop specific points or the general argument as much as possible?

*8 Dec - 3,000 word empirical research essay* (75%)

This essay should apply what you have learned so far and explore a question or theme related to transnational, global, or spatial history but do so empirically, that is, make use of historical primary sources to develop and argument about a particular case or answer a more focused analytical question. It should, of course, engage with existing historiography but is a chance for you to practice the skills of conducting your own original research on an area of transnational global, or spatial history. Please look to historical journals for examples of how journal articles focus in on a particular case and develop an argument around it. Again, however, the limited space you have for this essay makes it essential that you use your space wisely, choose a focus that allows you to develop points in depth, and not try to do too many different things in your essay.

You may wish to choose a topic that is related but not directly on the main area of interest for your dissertation, but keep in mind that you will not be able to reuse parts of this essay in that future work. You should ideally be spending at least a part of every week from the beginning of the semester evaluating potential sources and topics for this essay, and especially from the independent learning week on you should devote a significant proportion of your time to working on this essay. 

* Do I have a clearly identifiable, falsifiable, and non-trivial argument or answer an analytic question that takes an original approach, explores new sources, or goes beyond simply restating or summarising the existing scholarship?
* Have I chosen a scope that is manageable for a short research essay of this kind, allowing me to explore concrete points in sufficient detail to make an original and well-developed contribution?
* Have I taken a critical and sceptical approach to my sources, using them effectively to support my arguments, but also recognising their limitations and possible weaknesses.
* Have I acknowledged and engaged directly with some of the existing scholarship on this topic or most closely related topic in a way that sets my own work apart from it or identifies the inspiration for my own approach.
* Have I cited with footnotes all claims that are not a well-known and general historical fact?
* Does the essay avoid long quotations from secondary works whenever possible? Do I instead summarise, without plagiarising, and cite the work of secondary work except when the particular wording or language is key to the argument I wish to make?
* Does the essay have a clear conclusion which restates the main points and then makes some effort to contex- tualise the findings in the broader issues of the course?

4,000 empirical research essay - The second semester has a single research essay which is slightly longer than the fall, but should reflect your developing writing and research skills.
