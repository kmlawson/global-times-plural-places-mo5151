### Description	

This core module for the MLitt in Transnational and Spatial History offers a strong foundation in the major approaches to comparative and transnational history as well as the emerging field of spatial history. This first semester introduces the origins of these new ways of looking at the past, as well as some of the major methodological challenges faced. The course then shifts to consider transnational agents, networks, and new approaches to doing history between the micro and macro scales.

### Assessment Summary

**100% Coursework**  

**Fall:** 

26 Oct - 3,000 word historiographical essay

This first essay should choose a theme or question addressing some aspect of transnational or global history and explore the existing scholarship available. The essay should make a clear argument related to this theme and evaluate this argument in the light of other what other historians have to say. Primary sources are not required for this exercise. The assessment is designed as a way to get you to explore a field of scholarship in some depth. You may, if you like, choose a topic that is broadly helpful to you for your research essay in the spring for the core module, or at least indirectly related to topics you may be considering for the masters dissertation. 

30 Nov - 3,000 word empirical research essay

This essay should apply what you have learned so far and explore a question or theme related to transnational, global, or spacial history but do so empirically, that is, make use of historical primary sources to examine a particular case or more focused question. It should engage with existing historiography but also apply it to an area of the student's own research. 

**Spring:**: 

25 April - 6,000 research essay

This longer research essay can be on any topic in transnational, global or spatial history. It should not duplicate the research essay topic of your directed reading module, or your upcoming MLitt dissertation. However, you may choose something that is indirectly related to your dissertation interests, something that employs a similar methodology but a different context, or a different theme or question concerning the same geographical location, individuals, and so on. Ideally, your essay should put into practice some of the approaches and lessons learned from the readings so far, while moving beyond them.
